# A collection of notes for power management on Linux

The most common tools
- [Powertop](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/powertop) - Tool to identify ways to optimize power consumption. Does not have a daemon or anything like it.
- tlp
- Laptop Mode Tools 
- [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq) - Tries to let the kernel do the heavy lifting. This is my goto choice, but it falls short in certain areas such as ALPM. Recommends to run thermald alongside.
- thermald - TODO.
- [pm-utils](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/pm-utils/tree/README) - Don't know how this compares to the others. I think TLP depend on pm-utils.
- GNOME Power Profiles - This is appearently crap...
- UPower

(Does not include power management features that seem irrelevant for my laptop, like harddrive stuff, XFS etc.)

- Intel Audio power save - Seems to be enabled by default
- ASPM seems to have good settings by defaul. One liner to check status: `sudo lspci -vvv | grep LnkCtl`

## Storage

According to [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive) ALPM is usually disabled by default which can consume a lot of power.



## Sleep, hibernate and other scary stuff

`cat /sys/power/mem_sleep`

## Power management in Linux distros

- [Open SUSE](https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-power.html)
- [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement/PowerSavingTweaks)



# TODO
- [Investigate hiberation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate)
- Investigate Intel Rapid Start Technology
- Investigate possibility to use suspend-then-hibernate

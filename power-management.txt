# A collection of notes for power management on Linux

The most common tools
- [Powertop](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/powertop) - Tool to identify ways to optimize power consumption. Does not have a daemon or anything like it.
- tlp
- Laptop Mode Tools 
- [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq) - Tries to let the kernel do the heavy lifting. This is my goto choice, but it falls short in certain areas such as ALPM. Recommends to run thermald alongside.
- thermald - TODO.
- [pm-utils](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/pm-utils/tree/README) - Don't know how this compares to the others. I think TLP depend on pm-utils.
- GNOME Power Profiles - This is appearently crap...
- UPower

(Does not include power management features that seem irrelevant for my laptop, like harddrive stuff, XFS etc.)

- Intel Audio power save - Seems to be enabled by default
- ASPM seems to have good settings by defaul. One liner to check status: `sudo lspci -vvv | grep LnkCtl`

## Storage

According to [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive) ALPM is usually disabled by default which can consume a lot of power.



## Sleep, hibernate and other scary stuff

`cat /sys/power/mem_sleep`

# CPU frequency scaling

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling

`schedutil` was used on my UX303. This is because of the cpu scaling driver being set to `intel_cpufreq`.
```cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_driver```

It seems reasonable to asume that the hardware backed intel pstate scaling would do a better job.

How to change it to pstate: https://askubuntu.com/a/1184512

Some people seem to really dislike [shedutil](https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/software/general-linux-open-source/1486834-experimental-schedutil-patches-yield-30-boost-to-web-browser-benchmark-on-linux?p=1486848#post1486848).
Some people seem to reallt dislike [intel pstate](https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/hardware/processors-memory/1173150-initial-benchmarks-of-schedutil-performance-on-linux-5-7-show-room-still-for-improvement?p=1214010#post1214010).

I think I found [the reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/ihdozd/linux_kernel_58_defaults_to_passive_mode_for/) but I am not sure if it is valid:

# TODO
- [Investigate hiberation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate)
- Investigate Intel Rapid Start Technology
- Investigate possibility to use suspend-then-hibernate
